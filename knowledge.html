        <h2>Mechanical</h2>
        <h3>Mechanical Design of Prosthetic Hands &amp; Fingers</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To mimic natural hand and finger movement through lightweight, adaptable, and low-cost mechanical systems.</p>

        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Size, weight, and power constraints</li>
          <li>Balancing dexterity with mechanical simplicity</li>
          <li>Ensuring robustness, durability, and user comfort</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Actuation &amp; Joint Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Underactuation is common: fewer actuators than degrees of freedom (DoFs), using springs or linkages to adapt to object shapes.</li>
          <li>Linkage systems (four-bar, slider-crank, whiffle-tree) are widely used for finger flexion/extension.</li>
          <li>Tendon-driven systems offer compactness but can introduce friction and elasticity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Finger &amp; Hand Mechanisms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Commercial hands (e.g., iLimb, Bebionic, Michelangelo) use rigid or adaptive coupling between MCP and PIP joints.</li>
          <li>Research prototypes explore underactuation, self-adaptation, and modular designs for partial-hand prosthetics.</li>
          <li>Thumb design is critical: often includes circumduction for grasp switching (lateral vs. palmar).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Weight: &lt;500 g for full hand systems</li>
          <li>Grip force: ~20–80 N for precision/power grasps</li>
          <li>Speed: ~100–230°/s finger flexion</li>
          <li>Range of motion: ~90° for MCP/PIP joints</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Materials &amp; Fabrication</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3D printing (PLA, ABS) enables low-cost, customizable prosthetics.</li>
          <li>Nylon threads and fishing lines act as tendons for finger actuation.</li>
          <li>PLA is favored for biocompatibility and ease of printing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Innovations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Shape-adaptive fingers that conform to object geometry</li>
          <li>Modular and open-source designs for accessibility and customization</li>
          <li>Integration of force feedback to prevent object damage during grasping</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Modern prosthetic hands are becoming more functional, affordable, and user-friendly through advances in underactuated mechanisms, 3D printing, and adaptive design—moving closer to natural hand performance.</p>

      <div id="electronics" class="chapter-panel">
        <h2>Electronics</h2>

        <p>The electronics systems across the three prosthetic research projects focus on sensing, actuation, control, and energy management, enabling intuitive and functional device operation.</p>

        <h3>Sensing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Surface Electromyography (EMG) sensors detect muscle activity for myoelectric control, providing voltage signals that are amplified, rectified, and filtered to drive actuators.</li>
          <li>Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) track residual limb motion, capturing accelerometer and gyroscope data to model natural movement synergies for prosthetic wrist control.</li>
          <li>Linear potentiometers provide feedback on actuator stroke displacement, enabling closed-loop position control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Actuation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Linear actuators (e.g., Actuonix PQ 12-P) drive tendon-spring mechanisms for finger flexion and extension, offering precise stroke control with non-backdrivable mechanisms to maintain grip without continuous power.</li>
          <li>DC motors and servo motors are used in tendon-driven and linkage-based systems for both hand and wrist movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Control Systems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Microcontrollers (Arduino Nano) implement real-time control algorithms developed in MATLAB/Simulink for finger grip patterns and energy-saving strategies.</li>
          <li>Machine learning models—including neural networks and random forest regressors—decode user intent from IMU or EMG data and predict angular velocities for multi-degree-of-freedom wrist control.</li>
          <li>Feedback control uses on-off and PID strategies to minimize steady-state error and reduce power consumption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Power Management</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rechargeable Li-Ion batteries (e.g., 18650 cells) power actuators, sensors, and control boards.</li>
          <li>Energy-efficient control algorithms deactivate motors when positional error is within tolerance, significantly extending battery life during continuous use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Signal Processing & Communication</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Low-pass filtering removes noise from EMG and IMU signals.</li>
          <li>Motor drivers (e.g., L293D) manage actuator direction and speed.</li>
          <li>Real-time embedded systems run at sampling rates up to 50–148 Hz, ensuring responsive and natural prosthetic movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These electronic components and strategies collectively enable low-cost, responsive, and user-adaptive prosthetic systems suitable for daily living activities.</p>

      <div id="user-experience" class="chapter-panel">
        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        
        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trunk Movement:</strong> Increased forward displacement of the shoulder (acromion), especially for distant objects.</li>
          <li><strong>Altered Joint Kinematics:</strong> Greater elbow and shoulder range of motion compared to the non-amputated side.</li>
          <li><strong>Hand Orientation Adjustments:</strong> Prosthetic hand orientation is less adaptable, requiring postural adjustments to grasp different objects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rehabilitation & Adaptation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phases of Rehab:</strong> Includes pre-amputation, post-operative, pre-prosthetic training, prosthetic training, and lifelong care.</li>
          <li><strong>Training Emphasis:</strong> Focus on residual limb care, pain management, functional retraining, and psychological support.</li>
          <li><strong>Peer & Psychological Support:</strong> Critical for adjustment, motivation, and long-term prosthesis acceptance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Embodiment & Acceptance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Embodiment Score:</strong> Higher embodiment correlates with shorter reaching times and better integration of the prosthesis.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalization Needed:</strong> UX improves when prosthetic control adapts to individual movement patterns and compensatory behaviors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High Cognitive Load:</strong> Controlling myoelectric prostheses is non-intuitive, sequential, and requires continuous visual attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of Sensory Feedback:</strong> Users rely heavily on vision due to limited tactile or proprioceptive feedback from current devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Motor Adaptation & Compensations:</strong> Users develop compensatory movements (trunk flexion, shoulder abduction) to overcome prosthesis limitations, which can lead to musculoskeletal pain.</li>
          <li><strong>Prosthesis Abandonment:</strong> Common due to discomfort, poor cosmesis, lack of functional benefit, or difficulty in use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future UX Directions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intuitive Control Systems:</strong> Use of machine learning (e.g., neural networks) to adapt control in real-time.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensory Feedback Integration:</strong> Provide tactile or proprioceptive cues to reduce visual dependency.</li>
          <li><strong>Ergonomic Design:</strong> Reduce compensatory movements through better wrist/hand adaptability and lighter, more responsive devices.</li>
          <li><strong>User-Centered Training:</strong> Virtual reality and gamification to enhance engagement and motor learning.</li>
        </ul>
